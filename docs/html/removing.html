  <p>While we'll be sad to see you go, we're happy that Roo was able to
  help you in some way with your Spring-based projects. We also know that most
  people reading this chapter aren't actually likely to remove Roo at all, and
  are simply wondering how they'd go about it in the unlikely event they ever
  actually wanted to. If you have a source control system, it's actually a
  good idea to complete these instructions (without checking in the result!)
  just to satisfy yourself that it's very easy and reliable to remove
  Roo.</p>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="removing-how-avoids"></a>6.1.&nbsp;How Roo Avoids Lock-In</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>At the time we created the <a class="link" href="background.html#background-mission" title="C.2.&nbsp;Mission Statement">mission statement</a> for Roo, a key
    dimension was "<span class="emphasis"><em>without compromising engineering integrity or
    flexibility</em></span>". To us that meant not imposing an unacceptable
    burden on projects like forcing them to use the Roo API or runtime or
    locking them in. While it complicated our design to achieve this, we're
    very proud of the fact Roo's approach has no downside at runtime or
    lock-in or future flexibility. You really can have your cake and eat it
    too, to reflect on the common English expression.</p>

    <p>Roo avoids locking you in by adopting an active code generation
    approach, but unlike other code generators, we place Roo generated code in
    separate compilation units that use AspectJ inter-type declarations. This
    is vastly better than traditional active code generation alternatives like
    forcing you to extend a particular class, having the code generator extend
    one of your classes, or forcing you to program a model in an unnatural
    diagrammatic abstraction. With Roo you just get on with writing Java code
    and let Roo take care of writing and maintaining the code you don't want
    to bother writing.</p>

    <p>The other aspect of how Roo avoids lock-in is using annotations with
    <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html#SOURCE" target="_top">source-level
    retention</a>. What this means is the annotations are not preserved in
    your <code class="code">.class</code> files by the time they are compiled. This in turn
    means you do not need the Roo annotation library in your runtime
    classpath. If you look at your <code class="code">WEB-INF/lib </code>directory (if
    you're building a web project), you will find absolutely no Roo-related
    JARs. They simply don't exist. In fact if you look at your
    development-time classpath, only the Roo annotation JAR library will be
    present - and that JAR doesn't contain a single executable line of code.
    The entire behaviour of Roo is accomplished at development time when you
    load the Roo shell. If you also think about the absence of executable code
    anywhere in your project classpath, there is no scope for possible Roo
    bugs to affect your project, and there is no risk of upgrading to a later
    version of Roo.</p>

    <p>Because we recommend people check their Roo-generated
    <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files into source control, you don't even need to
    load Roo to perform a build of your project. The source-level annotation
    library referred to in the previous paragraph is in a public Maven
    repository and will automatically be downloaded to your computer if it's
    not already present. This means Roo is not part of your build process and
    your normal source control system branching and tagging processes will
    work.</p>

    <p>This also means that a project can "stop using Roo" by simply never
    loading the Roo shell again. Because the <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files are
    written to disk by the Roo shell when it last ran, even if it's never
    loaded again those files will still be present. The removal procedures in
    this chapter therefore focus on a more complete removal, in that you no
    longer even want the <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files any more. That said,
    there's nothing wrong with just never loading Roo again and keeping the
    <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files. The only possible problem of adopting the
    "never load Roo again" approach is that someone might load Roo again and
    those files will be updated to reflect the latest optimisations that Roo
    can provide for you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="removing-pros-cons"></a>6.2.&nbsp;Pros and Cons of Removing Roo</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>By removing Roo, you eliminate the Roo-generated source files from
    your project. These are inter-type declarations stored in
    <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files. You also remove the Roo annotation library
    from your project. This might be attractive if you've made a decision to
    no longer use Roo for some reason, or you'd like to ship the finished
    project to your client and they'd prefer a simple Java project where every
    piece of code is in standard <code class="code">.java</code> files. Another reason you
    might like to remove Roo is to simply satisfy yourself it's easy to do so
    and therefore eliminate a barrier to adopting Roo for real projects in the
    first place.</p>

    <p>Even though it's easy to do so, there are downsides of removing Roo
    from your project:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Cluttered Java classes</em></span>: If the
        <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files are removed, their contents need to go
        somewhere. That somewhere is into your <code class="code">.java</code> source
        files. This means your <code class="code">.java</code> source files will be
        considerably longer and contain code that no developer actually wrote.
        When developers open your <code class="code">.java</code> source files, they'll
        need to figure out what was written by hand and is unique to the
        class, what was automatically generated and then modified, and what
        was automatically generated and never modified. If using Roo this
        problem is eliminated, as anything automatically generated is in a
        separate, easily-identified source file.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>No round-trip support</em></span>: Let's imagine for a
        moment that you've written (either by hand or via your IDE's code
        generation feature) a <code class="code">toString()</code> method and getter/setter
        pairs for all your fields. You then decide to rename a field. Suddenly
        the getter, setter and <code class="code">toString()</code> methods are all in
        error. If you use Roo, it automatically detects your change and
        appropriately updates the generated code. If you remove Roo, you'll
        lose this valuable round-trip support and be doing a lot more tedious
        work by hand.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>No optimisations to generated files</em></span>: With
        each version of Roo we make improvements to the automatically-created
        <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files. These improvements are automatically
        made to your <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files when you load a new version
        of Roo. These improvements occasionally fix bugs, but more often
        provide new features and implement existing features more efficiently
        (remember eliminating engineering trade-offs and therefore maximising
        efficiency is a major objective in our <a class="link" href="background.html#background-mission" title="C.2.&nbsp;Mission Statement">mission statement</a>). If you remove
        the <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files, you'll receive the code as of that
        date and you'll miss out on further improvements we make.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Loss of Roo commands</em></span>: There are dozens of
        Roo commands available to assist you adapt to evolving project
        requirements. Next month you might be asked to add JMS services to
        your project. With Roo you just "<a class="link" href="command-index.html#command-index-jms-setup" title="A.18.3.&nbsp;jms setup">jms setup</a>". The month after
        you're asked about SMTP, so you just "<a class="link" href="command-index.html#command-index-email-sender-setup" title="A.24.1.&nbsp;email sender setup">email sender setup</a>".
        If you've eliminated Roo, you'll need to resort to much more
        time-consuming manual configuration (with its associated trial and
        error).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Deprecated library versions</em></span>: Because Roo
        automatically updates your code and has a good knowledge of your
        project, it's easy to always use the latest released versions of
        important runtime technologies like Spring and JPA. If you stop using
        Roo, you'll need to manually do all of the work involved in upgrading
        your project to newer versions. This will mean you're likely to end up
        on older runtime library versions that have bugs, fewer features and
        are not maintained or supported. With Roo you significantly mitigate
        this risk.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Undesirable architectural outcomes</em></span>: With
        Roo you achieve team-wide consistency and a solution with a high level
        of engineering integrity. If developers are forced to write
        repetitious code themselves and no longer enjoy optimised Roo
        commands, you'll likely find that over time you lose some of the
        consistency and engineering advantages of having used Roo in the first
        place.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Higher cost</em></span>: With the above in mind, you'll
        probably find development takes longer, maintenance takes longer and
        your runtime solution will be less efficient than if you'd stayed with
        Roo.</p>
      </li></ul></div>

    <p>As such we believe using Roo and continuing to use Roo makes a lot
    of sense. But if you're willing to accept the trade-offs of removing Roo
    (which basically means you switch to writing your project the unproductive
    "old fashioned way"), you can remove Roo very easily. Don't forget when in
    doubt you can always defer the decision. It's not as if Roo won't let you
    remove it just as easily in six months or two years from now!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="removing-step-by-step"></a>6.3.&nbsp;Step-by-Step Removal Instructions</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The following instructions explain how to remove Spring Roo from one
    of your projects that has to date been using Roo. Naturally if you'd
    simply like to remove Roo from your computer (as opposed to from an
    existing project), the process is as simple as removing the Roo
    installation directory and symbolic link. This section instead focuses on
    the removal from your projects.</p>

    <p>As mentioned above, a simple way of stopping to use Roo is to simply
    never load it again. The <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files will still be on
    disk and your project will continue to work regardless of whether the Roo
    shell is never launched again. You can even uninstall the Roo system from
    your computer and your project will still work. The advantage of this
    approach is you haven't lost most of the benefits of using Roo and it's
    very easy to simply reload the Roo shell again in the future. This section
    covers the more complete removal option should you not even want the
    <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files any more.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that enhancement request <a class="ulink" href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-222" target="_top">ROO-222</a>
    exists to replace step 1 with a Roo command, and <a class="ulink" href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-330" target="_top">ROO-330</a>
    similarly focuses on steps 2 and 3. Please vote for these enhancement
    requests if you'd like them actioned, although the instructions below
    still provide a fast and usable removal procedure.</p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="removing-step-by-step-1"></a>6.3.1.&nbsp;Step 1: Push-In Refactor</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Before proceeding, ensure you have quit any running Roo shell. We
      also recommend you run any tests and load your web application interface
      (if there is one) to verify your project works correctly before starting
      this procedure. We also recommend that you create a branch or tag in
      your source control repository that represents the present
      "Roo-inclusive" version, as it will help you should you ever wish to
      <a class="link" href="removing.html#removing-reversal" title="6.4.&nbsp;Reenabling Roo After A Removal">reenable Roo after a
      removal</a>.</p>

      <p>To remove Roo from a project, you need to import the project into
      Eclipse or SpringSource Tool Suite. Once the project has been imported
      into Eclipse, right-click the project name in Package Explorer and
      select Refactor &gt; Push-In Refactor. If this option is missing, ensure
      that you have a recent version of AJDT installed. After selecting the
      push-in refactor menu option, a list of all Roo inter-type declarations
      will be displayed. Simply click OK. AJDT will have now moved all of the
      Roo inter-type declarations into your standard <code class="code">.java</code> files.
      The old <code class="code">*_Roo_*.aj</code> files will have automatically been
      deleted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="removing-step-by-step-2"></a>6.3.2.&nbsp;Step 2: Annotation Source Code Removal</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>While your project is now free of inter-type declarations, your
      <code class="code">.java</code> files will still have <code class="code">@Roo</code> annotations
      within them. In addition, there will be <code class="code">import</code> directives
      at the top of your <code class="code">.java</code> files to import those
      <code class="code">@Roo</code> annotations. You can easily remove these unwanted
      members by clicking Search &gt; Search &gt; File Search, containing text
      "<code class="code">\n.*[@\.]Roo[^t_]+?.*$</code>" (without the quotes), file name
      pattern "<code class="code">*.java</code>" (without the quotes), ticking the "Regular
      expression" and "Case sensitive" check-boxes and clicking "Replace". When
      the next window appears and asks you for a replacement pattern, leave
      it blank and continue. All of the Roo statements will have now been
      removed. We have noticed for an unknown reason that sometimes this
      operation needs to be repeated twice in Eclipse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="removing-step-by-step-3"></a>6.3.3.&nbsp;Step 3: Annotation JAR Removal</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>By now your <code class="code">.java</code> files do not contain any Roo
      references at all. You therefore don't require the
      <code class="code">org.springframework.roo.annotations-*.jar</code> library in your
      development-time classpath. Simply open your <code class="code">pom.xml</code> and
      locate the <code class="code">&lt;dependency&gt;</code> element which contains
      <code class="code">&lt;artifactId&gt;org.springframework.roo.annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;</code>.
      Delete (or comment out) the entire <code class="code">&lt;dependency&gt;</code>
      element. If you're running m2Eclipse, there is no need to do anything
      further. If you used the command-line <code class="code">mvn</code> command to create
      your Eclipse <code class="code">.classpath</code> file, you'll need to execute
      <code class="code">mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse</code> to rebuild the
      <code class="code">.classpath</code> file.</p>

      <p>Roo has now been entirely removed from your project and you should
      re-run your tests and user interface for verification of expected
      operation. It's probably a good idea to perform another branch or tag in
      your source control repository so the change set is documented.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="removing-reversal"></a>6.4.&nbsp;Reenabling Roo After A Removal</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>If you decide to change your mind and start using Roo again, the
    good news is that it's relatively easy. This is because your project
    already uses the correct directory layout and has AspectJ etc properly
    configured. To re-enable Roo, simply open your pom.xml and re-add the
    <code class="code">org.springframework.roo.annotations</code>
    <code class="code">&lt;dependency&gt;</code> element. You can obtain the correct syntax
    by simply making a new directory, changing into that directory, executing
    <code class="code">roo script vote.roo</code>, and inspecting the resulting
    <code class="code">pom.xml</code>.</p>

    <p>Once you've added the dependency, you're free to load Roo from
    within your project's directory and start using the Roo commands again.
    You're also free to add <code class="code">@Roo</code> annotations to any
    <code class="code">.java</code> file that would benefit from them, but remember that
    Roo is "hands off by default". What that means is if you used the <a class="link" href="removing.html#removing-step-by-step-1" title="6.3.1.&nbsp;Step 1: Push-In Refactor">push-in refactor</a> command to move
    members (e.g. fields, methods, annotations etc) into the <code class="code">.java</code>
    file, Roo has no way of knowing that they originated from a push-in
    refactor as opposed to you having written them by hand. Roo therefore
    won't delete any members from your <code class="code">.java</code> file or override
    them in an inter-type declaration. </p>

    <p>Our advice is therefore (a) don't remove Roo in the first place or
    (b) if you have removed Roo and go back to using Roo again, delete the
    members from your <code class="code">.java</code> files that Roo is able to
    automatically manage for you. By deleting the members that Roo can manage
    for you from the <code class="code">.java</code> files, you'll gain the maximum benefit
    of your decision to resume using Roo. If you're unsure which members Roo
    can automatically manage, simply comment them out and see if Roo provides
    them automatically for you. Naturally you'll need the relevant
    <code class="code">@Roo</code> annotation(s) in your <code class="code">.java</code> files before
    Roo will create any members automatically for you.</p>

    <p>A final tip if you'd like to return to having ITDs again is that
    AJDT 2.0 and above offers a Refactor &gt; Push Out command. This may
    assist you in moving back to ITDs. The Edit &gt; Undo command also
    generally works if you decide to revert immediately after a Refactor &gt;
    Push In operation.</p>
