    <p><a class="ulink" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/" target="_top">Spring Roo</a>
    is an <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-usable-learnable" title="1.2.3.&nbsp;Usable and Learnable">easy-to-use</a>
    productivity tool for rapidly building enterprise applications in the Java
    programming language. It allows you to build <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-no-engineering-tradeoffs" title="1.2.4.&nbsp;No Engineering Trade-Offs">high-quality</a>,
    high-performance, <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-easy-removal" title="1.2.5.&nbsp;Easy Roo Removal">lock-in-free</a> enterprise
    applications <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-productivity" title="1.2.1.&nbsp;Higher Productivity">in just
    minutes</a>. Best of all, Roo works alongside your <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-standard-java" title="1.2.2.&nbsp;Stock-Standard Java">existing Java knowledge</a>,
    skills and experience. You probably won't need to learn anything new to
    use Roo, as there's no new language or runtime platform needed. You simply
    program in your normal Java way and Roo just works, sitting in the
    background taking care of the things you don't want to worry about.
    <span class="emphasis"><em>It's an approach unlike anything you've ever seen before, we
    guarantee it!</em></span></p>

    <p>You work with Roo by loading its "shell" in a window and leaving it
    running. You can interact with Roo via commands typed into the shell if
    you like, but most of the time you'll just go about programming in your
    text editor or IDE as usual. As you make changes to your project, Roo
    intelligently determines what you're trying to do and takes care of doing
    it for you automatically. This usually involves automatically detecting
    file system changes you've made and then maintaining files in response. We
    say "maintaining files" because Roo is <span class="emphasis"><em>fully round-trip
    aware</em></span>. This means you can change any code you like, at any time
    and without telling Roo about it, yet Roo will intelligently and
    automatically deal with whatever changes need to be made in response. It
    might sound magical, but it isn't. This documentation will clearly explain
    how Roo works and you'll find yourself loving the approach - just like so
    the many other people who are already using Roo.</p>

    <p>Before you start wondering how Roo works, let's confirm a few things
    it is NOT:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Roo is not a runtime</em></span>. Roo is not involved
        with your project when it runs in production. You won't find any Roo
        JARs in your runtime classpath or Roo annotations compiled into your
        classes. This is actually a wonderful thing. It means you have no
        lock-in to worry about (you can <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-easy-removal" title="1.2.5.&nbsp;Easy Roo Removal">remove Roo</a> from your
        project in just a couple of minutes!). It probably also means you
        won't need to get approval to use Roo (what's to approve when it's
        more like a command line tool than a critical runtime library like
        <a class="ulink" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/" target="_top">Spring
        Framework</a>?). It also means there is no technical way possible
        for Roo to slow your project down at runtime, waste memory or bloat
        your deployment artefacts with JARs. We're really proud of the fact
        that Roo imposes <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-no-engineering-tradeoffs" title="1.2.4.&nbsp;No Engineering Trade-Offs">no engineering
        trade-offs</a>, as it was one of our central design
        objectives.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Roo is not an IDE plugin</em></span>. There is no
        requirement for a "Roo Eclipse plugin" or "Roo IntelliJ plugin". Roo
        works perfectly fine in its own operating system command window. It
        sits there and monitors your file system, intelligently and
        incrementally responding to changes as appropriate. This means you're
        perfectly able to use vi or emacs if you'd like (Roo doesn't mind how
        your project files get changed).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Roo is not an annotation processing
        library</em></span>. There is a Java 6 feature known as the annotation
        processing API. Roo does not use this API. This allows Roo to work
        with Java 5, and also gives us access to a much more sophisticated and
        extensible internal model.</p>
      </li></ul></div>

    <p>So how does Roo actually work then? The answer to that question
    depends on how much detail you'd like. In super-summary form, Roo uses an
    add-on based architecture that performs a combination of passive and
    active code generation of <a class="link" href="architecture.html#architecture-critical-technologies-aspectj" title="3.2.1.&nbsp;AspectJ">inter-type
    declarations</a>. If you're interested in how that works at a practical
    project level, we cover that shortly in the "<a class="link" href="beginning.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial">Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial</a>" chapter. Or
    for an advanced look at Roo internals, we've covered that in <a class="link" href="internals.html" title="Part&nbsp;III.&nbsp;Internals and Add-On Development">Part III: Internals and Add-On
    Development</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="intro-why-use-it"></a>1.2.&nbsp;Why Use It</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>There are dozens of reasons people like to use Roo. We've worked
    hard to make it an attractive tool that delivers real value without
    imposing unpleasant trade-offs. Nonetheless, there are five major reasons
    why people like Roo and use it. Let's discuss these major reasons
    below.</p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro-why-use-it-productivity"></a>1.2.1.&nbsp;Higher Productivity</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>With Roo it is possible for Java developers to build sophisticated
      enterprise applications in a best-practice manner within minutes. This
      is not just a marketing claim, but it's a practical fact you can
      experience yourself by trying the <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-first-steps" title="1.5.&nbsp;First Steps: Your Own Web App in Under 10 Minutes">ten
      minute test</a>.</p>

      <p>Anyone who has programmed Java for a few years and looked at the
      alternatives on other platforms will be fully aware that enterprise Java
      suffers from productivity problems. It takes days to start a new project
      and incredibly long cycle times as you go about normal development.
      Still, we remain with Java because it's a highly attractive platform.
      It's the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html" target="_top">most
      widely used programming language</a> on the planet, with <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2007/01/1_in_every_10_java_developer_i.html" target="_top">millions</a>
      of competent developers. It has first-class tooling, excellent runtime
      performance, numerous mature libraries and widely-supported standards.
      Java is also open source, has multiple vendors and countless
      choice.</p>

      <p>We built Roo because we want enterprise Java developers to enjoy
      the same productivity levels that developers on other platforms take for
      granted. Thanks to Roo, Java developers can now enjoy this higher
      productivity <span class="emphasis"><em>plus</em></span> a highly efficient, popular,
      scalable, open, reliable platform. Best of all, in five years time it
      will still be possible to hire millions of people who can look at those
      Roo-based projects and understand what is going on and maintain them
      (even if you've <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-easy-removal" title="1.2.5.&nbsp;Easy Roo Removal">stopped
      using Roo</a> by then).</p>

      <p>Roo's higher productivity is provided both at original project
      creation, and also as a developer builds out the rest of the project.
      Because Roo provides round-trip support, the higher productivity is
      automatically provided over the full lifespan of a project. This is
      particularly important given the long-term maintenance costs of a
      project far outweigh the initial development costs. While you can use
      Roo just for an initial jump-start if you so wish, your return on
      investment is exponential as you continue using it throughout a project
      lifespan.</p>

      <p>Finally, while individual productivity is important, most of us
      work in teams and know that someday someone else will probably maintain
      the code we've written. As professionals we follow architectural
      standards and conventions to try and ensure that our present and future
      colleagues will be able to understand what we did, why, and have an easy
      time maintaining it. Our organisations often establish standards for us
      to follow in an effort to ensure other projects are tackled in similar
      ways, thus allowing people to transfer between projects and still be
      productive. Of course, most organisations also have people of greatly
      differing backgrounds and experiences, with new graduates typically
      working alongside more experienced developers and architect-level
      experts. Roo helps significantly in this type of real-world environment
      because it automatically implements specific design patterns in an
      optimal convention-over-configuration manner. This ensures consistency
      of implementation within a given Roo-based project, as well as across
      all other Roo-based projects within an organisation (and even outside
      your organisation, which greatly helps with hiring). Of course, the fact
      Roo builds on stock-standard Java also means people of vastly different
      experience levels can all be highly productive and successful with
      Roo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro-why-use-it-standard-java"></a>1.2.2.&nbsp;Stock-Standard Java</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>It's no longer necessary to switch platform or language to achieve
      extremely high levels of productivity! We designed Roo from the outset
      so those people with existing Java 5 knowledge, skills and experience
      would feel right at home. If you've ever built an enterprise application
      with Java, some or all of the technologies that Roo uses by default will
      already be familiar to you.</p>

      <p>Some of the common technologies Roo projects use include <a class="link" href="architecture.html#architecture-critical-technologies-spring" title="3.2.2.&nbsp;Spring">Spring</a> (such
      as Spring Framework, Spring Security and Spring Web Flow), Maven, Java
      Server Pages (JSP), Java Persistence API (JPA, such as Hibernate), Tiles
      and <a class="link" href="architecture.html#architecture-critical-technologies-aspectj" title="3.2.1.&nbsp;AspectJ">AspectJ</a>.
      We've chosen technologies which are extremely commonly used in
      enterprise Java projects, ensuring you've probably either already used
      them or at least will have no difficulty finding hundreds of thousands
      of other people who have (and the resultant books, blogs, samples etc
      that exist for each). Also, because most of these technologies are
      implemented using <a class="link" href="base.html" title="Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;Base Add-Ons">add-ons</a>, if you'd like Roo
      to use a different technology on your project it's quite easy to do
      so.</p>

      <p>By using standard Java technologies, Roo avoids reinventing the
      wheel or providing a limited-value abstraction over them. The
      technologies are available to you in their normal form, and you can use
      them in the same way as you always have. What Roo brings to the table is
      automatic setup of those technologies into a <a class="ulink" href="http://spring.io/" target="_top">Spring</a>-certified
      best-practice application architecture and, if you wish, automatic
      maintenance of all files required by those technologies (such as XML,
      JSP, Java etc). You'll see this in action when you complete the <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-first-steps" title="1.5.&nbsp;First Steps: Your Own Web App in Under 10 Minutes">ten minute test</a>.</p>

      <p>You'll also find that Roo adopts a very conservative, incremental
      approach to adding technologies to your project. This means when you
      first start a new project Roo will only assume you want to build a
      simple JAR. As such it will have next to no dependencies. Only when you
      ask to add a persistence provider will JPA be installed, and only when
      you add a field using JavaBean Validation annotations will that library
      be installed. The same holds true for Spring Security, Spring Web Flow
      and the other technologies Roo supports. With Roo you really do start
      small and incrementally add technologies if and when you want to, which
      is consistent with Roo's philosophy of there being <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-no-engineering-tradeoffs" title="1.2.4.&nbsp;No Engineering Trade-Offs">no engineering
      trade-offs</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro-why-use-it-usable-learnable"></a>1.2.3.&nbsp;Usable and Learnable</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>There are many examples of promising technologies that are simply
      too hard for most people to learn and use. With Roo we were inspired by
      the late Jef Raskin's book, "<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface" target="_top">The
      Humane Interface</a>". In the book Raskin argued we have a duty to
      make things so easy to use that people naturally "habituate" to the
      interface, that text-based interfaces are often more appropriate than
      GUIs, and that your "locus of attention" is all that matters to you and
      a machine should never disrupt your locus of attention and randomly
      impose its idiosyncratic demands upon you.</p>

      <p>With Roo we took these ideas to heart and designed a highly usable
      interface that lets you follow your locus of attention. This means you
      can do things in whatever order you feel is appropriate and never be
      subservient to the Roo tool. You want to delete a file? Just do it. You
      want to edit a file? Just do it. You want to change the version of
      Spring you're using? Just do it. You want to remove Roo? Just do it. You
      want to hand-write some code Roo was helping you with? Just do it. You
      want to use Emacs and Vim at the same time? No problem. You forgot to
      load Roo when you were editing some files? That's no problem either (in
      fact you can elect to never load Roo again and your project will remain
      just fine).</p>

      <p>Because Roo uses a text-based interface, there is the normal
      design trade-off between learnability, expressability and conciseness.
      No text-based interface can concurrently satisfy all three dimensions.
      With Roo we decided to focus on learnability and expressability. We
      decided conciseness was less important given the Roo shell would provide
      an intuitive, tab-based completion system. We also added other features
      to deliver conciseness, such as contextual awareness (which means Roo
      determines the target of your command based on the command completed
      before it) and command abbreviation (which means you need only type in
      enough of the command so Roo recognises what you're trying to
      do).</p>

      <p>The learnability of Roo is concurrently addressed on three fronts.
      First, we favor using <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-standard-java" title="1.2.2.&nbsp;Stock-Standard Java">standard Java
      technologies</a> that you probably already know. Second, we are
      careful to keep Roo out of your way. The more Roo simply works in the
      background automatically without needing your involvement, the less you
      <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to learn about it in the first place. This is
      consistent with Raskin's recommendation to never interrupt your locus of
      attention. Third, we offer a lot of learnability features in Roo itself.
      These include the "<a class="link" href="usage.html#usage-shell" title="4.2.&nbsp;Shell Features">hint</a>" command,
      which suggests what you may wish to do next based on your present
      project's state. It's quite easy to build an entire Roo project simply
      by typing "hint", pressing enter, and following the instructions Roo
      presents (we do this all the time during conference talks; it's always
      easier than remembering <a class="link" href="command-index.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Command Index">commands</a>!).
      There's also the <a class="link" href="usage.html#usage-shell" title="4.2.&nbsp;Shell Features">intelligent tab
      completion</a>, which has natural, friendly conventions like
      completing all mandatory arguments step-by-step (without distracting you
      with unnecessary optional arguments). There's also the online "<a class="link" href="usage.html#usage-shell" title="4.2.&nbsp;Shell Features">help</a>" command, <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-exploring-sample" title="1.6.&nbsp;Exploring the Roo Samples">sample scripts</a>, this
      documentation and plenty of <a class="link" href="resources.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Roo Resources">other
      resources</a>.</p>

      <p>Roo also follows a number of well-defined <a class="link" href="usage.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Usage and Conventions">conventions</a> so that you always know what it's
      doing. Plus it operates in a "fail safe" manner, like automatically
      undoing any changes it makes to the file system should something go
      wrong. You'll quickly discover that Roo is a friendly, reliable
      companion on your development journey. It doesn't require special
      handling and it's always there for you when you need it.</p>

      <p>In summary, we've spent a lot of time thinking about usability and
      learnability to help ensure you enjoy your Roo experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro-why-use-it-no-engineering-tradeoffs"></a>1.2.4.&nbsp;No Engineering Trade-Offs</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Roo doesn't impose any engineering trade-offs on your project. In
      fact, compared with most Spring-based enterprise applications, we're
      almost certain you'll find a Roo application will have a smaller
      deployment artefact, operate more quickly in terms of CPU time, and
      consume less memory. You'll also find you don't miss out on any of the
      usual IDE services like code assist, debugging and profiling. We'll
      explore how Roo achieves this below, but this information is relatively
      advanced and is provided mainly for architects who are interested in
      Roo's approach. As this knowledge is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> required
      to simply use Roo, feel free to jump ahead to the <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-why-use-it-easy-removal" title="1.2.5.&nbsp;Easy Roo Removal">next section</a> if you
      wish.</p>

      <p>Smaller deployment artefacts are achieved due to Roo's incremental
      dependency addition approach. You start out with a small JAR and then we
      add dependencies only if you actually need them. As of Roo 1.0.0, a
      typical Roo-based web application WAR is around 13 Mb. This includes
      major components like Spring, Spring JavaScript (with embedded Dojo) and
      Hibernate, plus a number of smaller components like URL rewriting. As
      such Roo doesn't waste disk space or give you 30+ Mb WARs, which results
      in faster uploads and container startup times.</p>

      <p>Speaking of startup times, Roo uses AspectJ's excellent
      compile-time weaving approach. This gives us a lot more power and
      flexibility than we'd ordinarily have, allowing us to tackle advanced
      requirements like advising domain objects and dependency injecting them
      with singletons. It also means the dynamic proxies typically created
      when loading Spring are no longer required. Roo applications therefore
      startup more quickly, as there's no dynamic proxy creation overhead.
      Plus Roo applications operate more quickly, as there's no dynamic proxy
      objects adding CPU time to the control flow.</p>

      <p>Because Roo's AspectJ usage means there are no proxy objects, you
      also save the memory expense of having to hold them. Furthermore, Roo
      has no runtime component, so you won't lose any memory or CPU time there
      either. Plus because Roo applications use Java as their programming
      language, there won't be any classes being created at runtime. This
      means a normal Roo application won't suffer exhaustion of permanent
      generation memory space.</p>

      <p>While some people would argue these deployment size, CPU and
      memory considerations are minor, the fact is they add up when you have a
      large application that needs to scale. With Roo your applications will
      use your system resources to their full potential. Plus as we move more
      and more enterprise applications into virtualized and cloud-hosted
      environments, the requirement for performant operation on shared
      hardware will become even more relevant.</p>

      <p>You'll also find that Roo provides a well thought out <a class="link" href="architecture.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Application Architecture">application architecture</a> that delivers
      pragmatism, flexibility and ease of maintainability. You'll see we've
      made architectural decisions like <a class="link" href="architecture.html#architecture-dao" title="3.6.&nbsp;Goodbye DAOs">eliminating the DAO layer</a>, using
      annotation-based dependency injection, and automatically providing
      dependency injection on entities. These decisions dramatically reduce
      the amount of Java and XML code you have to write and maintain, plus
      improve your development cycle times and refactoring experiences.</p>

      <p>With Roo, you don't have to make a trade-off between productivity
      or performance. Now it's easy to have both at the same time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="intro-why-use-it-easy-removal"></a>1.2.5.&nbsp;Easy Roo Removal</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>One of the biggest risks when adopting a new tool like Roo is the
      ease at which you can change your mind in the future. You might decide
      to remove a tool from your development ecosystem for many different
      reasons, such as changing requirements, a more compelling alternative
      emerging, the tool having an unacceptable number of bugs, or the tool
      not adequately supporting the versions of other software you'd like to
      use. These risks exist in the real world and it's important to mitigate
      the consequences if a particular tool doesn't work out in the
      long-term.</p>

      <p>Because Roo does not exist at runtime, your risk exposure from
      using Roo is already considerably diminished. You can decide to stop
      using Roo and implement that decision without even needing to change any
      production deployment of the application.</p>

      <p>If you do decide to stop using Roo, this can be achieved in just a
      few minutes. There is no need to write any code or otherwise make
      significant changes. We've covered the short removal process in a
      dedicated <a class="link" href="removing.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Removing Roo">removing Roo</a> chapter, but in
      summary you need to perform a "push in refactor" command within Eclipse
      and then do a quick regular expression-based find and replace. That's
      all that is needed to 100% remove Roo from your project. We often remove
      Roo from a project during conference demonstrations just to prove to
      people how incredibly easy it is. It really only takes two to three
      minutes to complete.</p>

      <p>We believe that productivity tools should earn their keep by
      providing you such a valuable service that you <span class="emphasis"><em>want
      </em></span>to continue using them. We've ensured Roo will never lock you
      in because (a) it's simply the right and credible thing to do
      engineering-wise and (b) we want Roo to be such an ongoing help on your
      projects that you actually <span class="emphasis"><em>choose </em></span>to keep it. If
      you're considering alternative productivity tools, consider whether they
      also respect your right to decide to leave and easily implement that
      decision, or if they know you're locked in and can't do much about
      it.</p>

    <p>Roo is a standard Java application that is fully self-contained
    within the Roo distribution ZIPs. You can download Roo from one of the
    <a class="link" href="resources.html#resources-downloads" title="D.2.&nbsp;Downloads and Maven Repositories">download sites</a>, or <a class="link" href="development.html#development-setup" title="16.3.&nbsp;Setting Up for Development">build</a> a distribution ZIP yourself from
    our <a class="link" href="resources.html#resources-source-repository" title="D.6.&nbsp;Source Repository">source control
    repository</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are upgrading from an existing version of Spring Roo, you
    should consult the <a class="link" href="upgrade.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Upgrade Notes and Known Issues">upgrade notes</a> for
    important information.</p>

    <p>Before attempting to install Roo, please ensure you have the
    following system dependencies:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        <p>A Linux, Apple or Windows-based operating system (other
        operating systems may work but are not guaranteed)</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>A Java 6 or 7 installation, with the
        <code class="code">$JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable pointing to the
        installation. Note that Java 8 is currently not supported.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Apache Maven 2.0.9 or above installed and in the path</p>
      </li></ul></div>

    <p>We have listed various considerations concerning the Java
    Development Kit (JDK) and operating systems in the <a class="link" href="upgrade.html#upgrade-known-issues" title="B.1.&nbsp;Known Issues">known issues</a> section of this
    documentation. We always recommend you use the latest version of Java and
    Maven that are available for your platform. We also recommend that you use
    <a class="ulink" href="http://spring.io/tools/sts" target="_top">Spring
    Tool Suite</a> (STS), which is our free Eclipse-based IDE that includes
    a number of features that make working with Roo even easier (you can of
    course use Roo with normal Eclipse or without an IDE at all if you
    prefer).</p>

    <p>Once you have satisfied the initial requirements, you can install
    Roo by following these steps:</p>

    <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>
        <p>Unzip the Roo installation ZIP to a directory of your choice;
        this will be known as <code class="code">$ROO_HOME</code> in the directions
        below</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>If using Windows, add <code class="code">$ROO_HOME\bin</code> to your
        <code class="code">%PATH%</code> environment variable</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>If using Linux or Apple, create a symbolic link using a command
        such as <code class="code">sudo ln -s $ROO_HOME/bin/roo.sh
        /usr/bin/roo</code></p>
      </li></ol></div>

    <p>Next verify Roo has been installed correctly. This can be done using
    the following commands:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="bold"><strong>mkdir roo-test</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>cd roo-test</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>roo quit</strong></span>

Welcome to Spring Roo. For assistance press TAB or type "hint" then hit ENTER.
$ <span class="bold"><strong>cd ..</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>rmdir roo-test</strong></span></pre>

    <p>If you see the logo appear, you've installed Roo successfully. For
    those curious, the "[rev RRR]" refers to the Git commit ID used to compile
    that particular build of Roo.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="intro-roo-opts"></a>1.4.&nbsp;Optional ROO_OPTS Configuration</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The standalone Roo shell supports fine-tuning display-related
    configuration via the ROO_OPTS environment variable. An environment
    variable is used so that these configuration settings can be applied
    before the shell is instantiated and the first messages displayed. The
    ROO_OPTS settings does not apply within Spring Tool Suite's embedded
    Roo shell.</p>

    <p>At present the only configuration settings available is roo.bright.
    This causes foreground messages in the shell to be displayed with brighter
    colors. This is potentially useful if your background color is light (e.g.
    white). You can set the variable using the following commands:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="bold"><strong>export ROO_OPTS="-Droo.bright=true"</strong></span>                   // Linux or Apple
$ <span class="bold"><strong>set ROO_OPTS="-Droo.bright=true"</strong></span>                      // Windows users</pre><p>There
    is an enhancement request within our issue tracker for customisable shell
    color schemes. If you're interested in seeing this supported by Roo, you
    may wish to consider voting for <a class="ulink" href="http://jira.springframework.org/browse/ROO-549" target="_top">ROO-549</a>.</p>

    <p>Now that you have installed Roo, let's spend a couple of minutes
    building an enterprise application using Roo.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this application is just to try out Roo. We won't
    explain what's going on in these steps, but don't worry - we'll do that in
    the next chapter, <a class="link" href="beginning.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial">Beginning With Roo: The
    Tutorial</a>. We will try to teach you about some usability features as
    we go along, though.</p>

    <p>Please start by typing the following commands:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="bold"><strong>mkdir ten-minutes</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>cd ten-minutes</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>roo</strong></span>

Welcome to Spring Roo. For assistance press TAB or type "hint" then hit ENTER.
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>hint</strong></span>
Welcome to Roo! We hope you enjoy your stay!

Before you can use many features of Roo, you need to start a new project.

To do this, type 'project' (without the quotes) and then hit TAB.

Enter a --topLevelPackage like 'com.mycompany.projectname' (no quotes).
When you've finished completing your --topLevelPackage, press ENTER.
Your new project will then be created in the current working directory.

Note that Roo frequently allows the use of TAB, so press TAB regularly.
Once your project is created, type 'hint' and ENTER for the next suggestion.
You're also welcome to visit http://forum.springframework.org for Roo help.</pre>

    <p>Notice the output from the "hint" command guides you through what to
    do next. Let's do that:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>project --topLevelPackage com.tenminutes</strong></span>
Created /home/balex/ten-minutes/pom.xml
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA
Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES
Created SRC_TEST_JAVA
Created SRC_TEST_RESOURCES
Created SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP
Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES/META-INF/spring
Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES/META-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>hint</strong></span>
Roo requires the installation of a JPA provider and associated database.

Type 'jpa setup' and then hit TAB three times.
We suggest you type 'H' then TAB to complete "HIBERNATE".
After the --provider, press TAB twice for database choices.
For testing purposes, type (or TAB) HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY.
If you press TAB again, you'll see there are no more options.
As such, you're ready to press ENTER to execute the command.

Once JPA is installed, type 'hint' and ENTER for the next suggestion.</pre>

    <p>At this point you've now got a viable Maven-based project setup. But
    let's make it more useful by setting up JPA. In the interests of time,
    I'll just include the commands you should type below. Be sure to try using
    the TAB key when using the shell, as it will save you from having to type
    most of these commands:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>jpa setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>hint</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>entity jpa --class ~.Timer --testAutomatically</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>hint</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>field string --fieldName message --notNull</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong><span class="bold"><strong>hint </strong></span>web mvc</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>web mvc setup</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>web mvc all --package ~.web</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>selenium test --controller ~.web.TimerController</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>perform tests</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>perform package</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>perform eclipse</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>quit</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>mvn tomcat:run</strong></span></pre>

    <p>The "<a class="link" href="command-index.html#command-index-maven-commands" title="A.25.&nbsp;Maven Commands">perform</a>"
    commands could have been easily undertaken from the command prompt using
    "mvn" instead. We just did them from within Roo to benefit from TAB
    completion. You could have also skipped the "<a class="link" href="command-index.html#command-index-perform-eclipse" title="A.25.10.&nbsp;perform eclipse">perform eclipse</a>" command if
    you are using the m2eclipse plugin. If you are using Spring Tool
    Suite (STS), it automatically includes m2eclipse and as such you do not
    need to use the "perform eclipse" command. Indeed if you're an STS user,
    you could have started your Roo project right from within the IDE by
    selecting the File &gt; New &gt; Spring Roo menu option and completing the
    steps. In that case a Roo Shell view will open within STS and from there
    you can enter the remaining commands.</p>

    <p>Now that you've loaded Tomcat, let's run the Selenium tests. You can
    do this by loading a new command window, changing into the ten-minutes
    directory, and then executing <code class="code">mvn selenium:selenese</code>. You
    should see your FireFox web browser execute the generated Selenium tests.
    You can also visit your new web application at <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost:8080/tenminutes" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/tenminutes</a>,
    which should look similar to the picture below.</p>

    <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/tenminutes.png"></div>

    <p>Naturally in this short ten minute test we've skipped dozens of
    features that Roo can provide, and didn't go into any detail on how you
    could have customised the application. We just wanted to show you that Roo
    works and you can build an application in record-time. The <a class="link" href="beginning.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial">Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial</a> chapter will
    go through the process of building an application in much more depth,
    including how to work with your IDE and so on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="intro-exploring-sample"></a>1.6.&nbsp;Exploring the Roo Samples</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Now that you've built your first application during the <a class="link" href="intro.html#intro-first-steps" title="1.5.&nbsp;First Steps: Your Own Web App in Under 10 Minutes">ten minute test</a>, you have a rough idea
    of how Roo works. To help you learn Roo we ship several sample scripts
    that can be used to build new applications. These sample scripts can be
    found in your $ROO_HOME/classpath/src/main/resources/ directory.
    These sample scripts available from roo classpath. You can
    run any sample script by using the following command format:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="bold"><strong>mkdir sample</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>cd sample</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>roo</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>script --file filename.roo</strong></span>
roo&gt; <span class="bold"><strong>quit</strong></span>
$ <span class="bold"><strong>mvn tomcat:run</strong></span></pre>

    <p>The <code class="code">filename.roo</code> shown in the statements above should
    be substituted with one of the filenames from this list (note that you get
    filename completion using TAB):</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>clinic.roo</em></span>: The Petclinic sample script is
        our most comprehensive. It builds a large number of entities,
        controllers, Selenium tests and dynamic finders. It also sets up Log4J
        and demonstrates entity relationships of different
        cardinalities.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>vote.roo</em></span>: The Voting sample script was
        built live on-stage during SpringOne Europe 2009, as detailed in the
        project <a class="link" href="background.html#background-history" title="C.1.&nbsp;History">history</a> section.
        This is a nice sample script because it's quite small and only has two
        entities. It also demonstrates Spring Security usage.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>wedding.roo</em></span>: The Wedding RSVP sample script

        you're looking for another Roo tutorial, this sample script (along
        with the associated blog entry) is a good choice. This project
        includes Selenium tests, dynamic finders and Log4j
        configuration.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>pizzashop.roo</em></span>: The PizzaShop sample script
        demonstrates Roo's integration of JPA composite primary keys. It
        produces a headless application which is accessible via JSON
        (available through Spring MVC REST integration). To add a Web UI on
        top of it, simply run the <a class="link" href="command-index.html#command-index-web-mvc-all" title="A.5.3.&nbsp;web mvc all">web mvc all</a> command. The
        application is described in greater detail in our <a class="link" href="beginning.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial">tutorial</a>.</p>

    <p>As we draw to the close of this first chapter, you know what Roo is,
    why you'd like to use it, have installed it and completed the ten minute
    test, plus you know which samples are available. You could probably stop
    at this point and apply Roo productively to your projects, but we
    recommend that you spend a couple of hours learning more about Roo. It
    will be time well spent and easily recouped by the substantially greater
    productivity Roo will soon deliver on your projects.</p>

    <p>The next step is to complete the <a class="link" href="beginning.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Beginning With Roo: The Tutorial">Beginning
    With Roo: The Tutorial</a> chapter. In the tutorial chapter you'll
    learn how to use Roo with your preferred IDE and how flexible and natural
    it is to develop with Roo. After that you should read the <a class="link" href="architecture.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Application Architecture">application architecture</a> chapter to
    understand what Roo applications look like. From there you might wish to
    wrap up the recommended tour of Roo with a skim over the <a class="link" href="usage.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Usage and Conventions">usage and conventions</a> chapter. This final
    recommended chapter will focus more on using the Roo tool and less on the
    applications that Roo creates.</p>

    <p>If you can't find the information you're looking for in this
    reference guide, the <a class="link" href="resources.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Roo Resources">resources chapter</a>
