WELCOME TO SPRING ROO!
======================================================================

Thank you for taking the time to download and install Spring Roo.

You're now only a few minutes away from enterprise applications that
are considerably faster to build and maintain, faster to execute,
require less memory, and use the latest Java technologies in a best
practice, architecturally-optimal manner. We know that sounds too good
to be true, but you'll be able to see this for yourself very shortly!

We're prepared comprehensive documentation to guide you on your Roo
journey. This includes installation instructions, and how to complete
the "ten minute test" of building an application from scratch and
starting it up. You can find this documentation (in several formats)
in your main Roo installation directory:

  $ROO_HOME/docs/html/index.html
  $ROO_HOME/docs/pdf/spring-roo-docs.pdf

You can also find documentation online at:

If you use Twitter, you're encouraged to follow @SpringRoo. Also
please use @SpringRoo in your tweets so everyone can easily see them.

Once again, welcome to the Spring Roo community! We hope that you find
Roo as much fun to work with as we have had in building it.
